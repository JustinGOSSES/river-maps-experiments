place to play around making maps of rivers to try a few things

## Data

The data folder if not pushed to origin to avoid storage fees

All these were from: https://gishub-h-gac.hub.arcgis.com/
- USCB_Urban_Areas_2010.geojson
- USGS_HUC_10_Watersheds.geojson
- USGS_HUC_12_Subwatersheds.geojson
- HGAC_Major_Rivers.geojson

Lots of interesting mapping of river health that might be cool to extract here: https://h-gac.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=30b802d67f5d4a2aa7915cc30bca9318

Might also look at this 100m resolution land cover of USA from UT library https://geodata.lib.utexas.edu/catalog/stanford-sw186vh2473

Or the USGS land cover USA: https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/national-land-cover-database

Unsure if this map will allow export but it does have good Harris and Galveston county Land Use details: https://datalab.h-gac.com/RLUIS/
